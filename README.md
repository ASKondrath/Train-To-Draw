# Train-To-Draw
A python script for learning how to draw what you see. Example results can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5Lr388_FWCCTG9OZDFfN2xYQ3c).

The goal of this project was to train myself how to draw. I needed to learn how to draw what was in front of me and not a representation of what my brain thought it saw. For instance, a nose its not just a pair of nostrils and a few curves. It is different shades of irregular shapes. 

In order to help myself "see" properly, I had to break the image and small blocks. The objective was to avoid letting my brain interpret what it was seeing. I tape a grid behind my drawing paper. This grid is visible enough to match with the grid on the image, and helps keep my lines more accurate. 

Another important aspect of drawing is shading. This gives pictures depth and helps them feel more lifelike. I start off at the lightest shade possible to get a basic outline of the image. I slowly increase the shading layer by layer to add details to the picture. The whole process is slow but the final outcome is worth it.
